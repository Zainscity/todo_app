## Prompt

```text

```

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for the Todo Full-Stack Web Application with 61 specific, actionable tasks organized across 6 phases. Tasks are organized by user story priority (P1, P1, P2) with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified. Each task follows the required checklist format with sequential IDs, story labels where appropriate, and specific file paths. The implementation strategy follows an MVP approach focusing on authentication and basic task operations first.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown with 61 specific, actionable items
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run for task generation phase
- 📁 Files: 1 file created with comprehensive task list
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story with proper dependencies and parallel opportunities

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of setup tasks
